# MhFirouzjah ZSH Config

inspired by [Manjaro ZSH Config](https://github.com/Chrysostomus/manjaro-zsh-config)  
This config works for WSL too, the following image is a screenshot of my debian wsl.

```sh
  git clone https://github.com/mh-firouzjah/mhfirouzjah-zsh-config.git ~/.mhfirouzjah-zsh-config
